<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
</div>

<p class="faqText">We get a lot of questions here at Strinny Water since we're so popular and we'd like to address and answer those questions to clear up anything you folks might be thinking out there.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p class="qanda1">
<em>Do you use fresh plastic or recycled plastic?</em>
<br>
<strong>We make sure to only use recycled plastic since we know how important it is to look after the environment!</strong>
<br>
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p class="qanda2">
    <em>How pure is your water?</em>
    <br>
    <strong>Our water is as pure as pure can get, we purify our water using a filtration system which is then distilled and enriched to not take away the mineral content.</strong>
</p>
<br>
<p class="qanda3">
    <em>What do you do during the hotter months of the year, say if there was a drought?</em>
    <br>
    <strong>During the hottest part of the year and during droughts we make sure to leave the reservoir alone since we wouldn't want to add to the water shortage we would be facing plus we still use plenty of our water to supply the livestock locally.</strong>
